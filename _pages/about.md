Hi there! I'm **Amar**, a data scientist who occasionally writes about my adventures in the world of data on this (very rarely) updated blog. When I'm not knee-deep in code and datasets, you might find me gaming, at the gym, or playing my 20th season with Brighton on Football Manager.

Feel free to explore my blog, where I dive into various aspects of data science, from machine learning techniques and data visualisation to real-world applications across industries. While I have a soft spot for football analytics, you'll find a diverse range of topics that showcase the power and versatility of data science.

Oh, and don't worry, I'll make sure to make everything on this blog easy to understand, even if you don't have a technical background. 

Thanks for reading! **ðŸ˜ƒ**
